This is Kaia Hospodarsky Final Project: Food Storage Calculator

You add the food along with the weight, amount (number of container or bags you want to get), and optionaly price for one container/bag.
You will select the category you want your food in.
If you do not add a price it will give an estimated price.

It will determine a estimated total price based on all food entered in.
It will determine a estimated total space/volume all the food will take up.

It will also determine how much you want to have in your food storage based off the age of the person. If you have
a big family you will have to enter each person age in individualy.

The sources.txt file contains any sources I used to created my project including where I got value & prices from.
